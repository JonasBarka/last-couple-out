# Last Couple Out
Experimenting with Blazor, PWA and Github Actions by recreating an application I once made for the live action role playing game Last Couple Out.
I might even end up hosting the game again.

Try the very much work in progress application hosted on [Gihub Pages here](https://jonasbarka.github.io/last-couple-out/).

### A selection of libraries used in the application
* [Radzen Blazor Components](https://github.com/radzenhq/radzen-blazor)
* [Blazored LocalStorage](https://github.com/Blazored/LocalStorage)
* [Publish SPA for GitHub Pages](https://github.com/jsakamoto/PublishSPAforGitHubPages.Build)
